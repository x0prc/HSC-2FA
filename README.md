# HSC-2FA
Honeytoken Driven Smart Contract 2FA Implementation

A minimal yet powerful proof-of-concept demo for two-factor authentication using honeytokens (decoy credentials/actions) and blockchain smart contracts, fully operated via the terminal/CLI. Selecting a decoy triggers real-time alerts for enhanced security in sensitive cloud or administrative environments.

## Features

- **Blockchain-Enforced 2FA:** Authentication flows via smart contracts (Ethereum-compatible).
- **Honeytoken Security:** Randomized decoy options mixed with real choices in each session.
- **CLI:** No web interfaceâ€”just pure terminal for sysadmins and engineers.
- **Instant Alerts:** Decoy/honeytoken selection emits blockchain events, triggers notifications.


## Security Notes

- Always keep private keys secure.
- Prefer hardware wallets for maximum security.
- Rotate honeytoken options periodically.
